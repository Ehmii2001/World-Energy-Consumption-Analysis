# World Energy Consumption Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes global energy consumption trends over the last 40+ years. The goal is to explore patterns in energy usage, compare fossil fuels versus renewable energy, and identify insights that could inform energy policy, sustainability, or investment decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: World Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and contains columns such as: Country, Year, Energy Type, and Consumption (TWh). It includes multiple energy sources across different countries and decades.

## Key Findings
- Global energy consumption has steadily increased since 1980.  
- Coal and oil remain dominant in many regions, while renewable energy sources are growing rapidly in others.  
- Some countries have significantly reduced fossil fuel dependency and increased renewable energy adoption.  
- Patterns reveal opportunities for sustainable energy planning and policy-making.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, formatting data, preparing datasets for analysis using Python and Pandas.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies in large datasets.  
- **Data Visualization:** Creating clear and informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- **Optional Modeling:** Linear regression / forecasting energy trends.  
- **Version Control & Documentation:** Using GitHub to organize and present the project professionally.

## How to View
The notebook already contains all code, outputs, and visualizations. You can view it directly on GitHub. No need to run anything to see results.  

If you want to rerun or modify the notebook:
1. Open it in **Google Colab** (free, cloud-based) or on your local machine.  
2. Install required libraries if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
